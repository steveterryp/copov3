## Test User Registration Flow

Please follow these steps to test the user registration flow:

1.  **Open Browser:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3002`.
2.  **Go to Registration Page:** Access the registration page. This is typically found at a URL like `/auth/register` or by clicking a "Register" link on the homepage.
3.  **Fill Registration Form:** Complete the registration form with the following information:
    *   **Email:** Enter a new email address that you have access to.
    *   **Name:** Enter your name.
    *   **Password:** Create a new password.
4.  **Submit Form:** Click the "Register" or "Sign Up" button to submit the registration form.
5.  **Check Email Inbox:** Open your email inbox for the email address you used during registration. Look for a verification email. This might take a few minutes to arrive and could be in your spam or junk folder.
6.  **Click Verification Link:** Open the verification email and click on the verification link provided in the email.
7.  **Set Password Page:** After clicking the verification link, you should be redirected to a page in your browser to set your password. Set a new password if prompted, or proceed if the password was already set during registration.
8.  **Login:** Navigate to the login page (usually `/auth/login` or a "Login" link). Enter the email address and the password you used for registration.
9.  **Verify Login:** Click the "Login" or "Sign In" button. If the login is successful and you are redirected to the application's dashboard or main page, the registration flow is working correctly.
10. **Report Issues:** If you encounter any errors during these steps, or if the login is not successful, please describe the issues in detail, including any error messages you see. This information will be helpful for further debugging.

Thank you for testing the registration flow!
