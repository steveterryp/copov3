# Branch Comparison: feature/ui-improvements vs main

## Overview
The feature/ui-improvements branch introduces substantial enhancements to the application's user interface, navigation system, and overall architecture. This branch represents a significant step forward in improving the user experience and maintainability of the codebase.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dashboard Architecture Improvements
- Implemented new dashboard layout structure with dedicated pages:
  - Analytics dashboard (`/analytics`)
  - Team management interface (`/team`)
  - Settings configuration (`/settings`)
  - PoV (Point of View) management:
    - List view (`/pov/list`)
    - Creation interface (`/pov/create`)
    - Main PoV dashboard (`/pov`)
### 2. Authentication System Enhancement
- Refined authentication endpoints:
  - Enhanced `/api/auth/me` route for user information
  - Improved token management through `/api/auth/refresh` and `/api/auth/revoke`
  - Added WebSocket token support via `/api/auth/ws-token`
  - Updated authentication test helpers for improved testing coverage

### 3. API Infrastructure
- Enhanced dashboard data handling with improved PoV overview endpoint
- Implemented robust error handling and authentication middleware
- Added comprehensive test coverage for API endpoints
- Improved API response structure with consistent error handling
  - Standardized error response format with data, status, and error fields
  - Enhanced type safety for API responses
  - Added validation error handling with detailed error messages

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Introduced new navigation components for improved user flow
- Enhanced login page interface
- Implemented responsive dashboard layout
- Added new UI components for better user interaction

### 5. Documentation and Standards
- Added `.clinerules` for consistent development practices
- Enhanced documentation for:
  - Component architecture
  - State management
  - UI/UX guidelines
