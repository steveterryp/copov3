Now that you’ve successfully implemented and passed your initial test suites—resolving type conflicts and creating a maintainable testing infrastructure—you’ve cleared a major foundational hurdle. With the testing environment stable, you can revise your next steps to focus on refining the backend and moving toward the front-end UI layer more confidently.

### Updated Recommendations

1. **Finalize and Validate Core Backend Flows**  
    **Rationale:** You now have a working test environment, which means you can more thoroughly verify that your backend logic is sound. Before integrating a UI component library, ensure that your authentication, database operations, and core APIs behave as expected under test conditions.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Add integration tests that hit your `/api/auth` routes (register, login, refresh, logout) to confirm they work as intended.
    - Validate your Prisma models and migrations with more complex scenarios (e.g., multiple users, expired tokens) in tests.
    - Confirm that the error handling and response structures are consistent and tested.
2. **Confirm Database Stability and Models**  
    **Rationale:** Your tests can also help confirm that the database structure is correct. If you find edge cases during testing—such as what happens when a user tries to register with an existing email—handle them now so you don’t have to redesign UI components later.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Run tests that create, read, and delete test data.
    - Ensure referential integrity and cascading deletes (like in `RefreshToken` relations) are behaving correctly.
3. **Establish or Refine State Management (If Needed)**  
    **Rationale:** With API and DB confidence high, consider how you’ll handle client-side state before adding a UI library. While not mandatory, having a structure (e.g., React Query for data fetching or Redux/Zustand for global state) will make it easier to integrate UI components.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Decide on your client-side data fetching strategy. React Query is often a great fit with Next.js for caching and managing server state.
    - If complex global state is required (e.g., user session management on the client, complex dashboards, etc.), set it up now. Your tests can guide you in verifying that state behaves as intended in different scenarios.
4. **Introduce Material-UI (MUI)**  
    **Rationale:** With backend and state management patterns established, it’s now a good time to bring in MUI. Your tests will help ensure that changes in the UI layer do not break existing logic. MUI will provide consistent design patterns and components, making front-end development smoother.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Install and configure MUI:
        
        ```bash
        npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
        ```
        
    - Create a custom theme and integrate it into `app/layout.tsx`.
    - Start building out basic components (navigation, headers, footers) and write snapshot or rendering tests to ensure they integrate well with your backend routes.
5. **Refine UI and Add Features**  
    **Rationale:** With MUI in place, you can confidently build out your pages. Since the backend is tested and stable, and state management (if any) is settled, your focus can shift to crafting a polished user experience.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Implement the main UI pages (dashboard, login page, etc.) using MUI components.
    - Use testing tools such as `@testing-library/react` to ensure that UI components render correctly and respond appropriately to mocked API calls.
    - Integrate responsive design and accessibility checks to ensure a great user experience on all devices.
6. **Maintain Documentation and Coverage**  
    **Rationale:** Your test environment and approach have evolved. Update your documentation to reflect the new testing strategy and ensure future developers understand how to run and write tests.
    
    **Actions:**
    
    - Update `cline_docs` with instructions on running tests, adding new tests, and understanding the testing environment.
    - Consider adding a coverage report step (via `jest --coverage`) to see if certain areas need more tests.
    - Keep `projectRoadmap.md` and `codebaseSummary.md` updated to track progress.

### Summary

You’ve conquered the complex initial testing setup, so the next logical steps involve solidifying your backend and data model usage, potentially establishing a client-side state pattern, and then layering on MUI to bring your UI to life. With tests now stable and maintainable, you can confidently progress knowing that regressions will be caught early and that your codebase will stay clean and reliable.
