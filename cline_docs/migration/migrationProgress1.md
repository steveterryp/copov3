## Key Learnings

### Component Export Patterns
1. Shadcn UI components should use named exports rather than default exports
2. When migrating components, check for both direct imports and destructured imports
3. Components often export multiple related subcomponents (e.g., Dialog exports DialogContent, DialogHeader, etc.)

### Form Handling
1. Form components work closely with react-hook-form
2. Form structure changes:
   - Material UI: Direct form element usage
   - Shadcn UI: Structured form components with FormField, FormItem, FormLabel pattern

### Dialog Implementation
1. Dialog component is built on Radix UI primitives
2. Requires proper nesting of components:
   ```tsx
   <Dialog>
     <DialogContent>
       <DialogHeader>
         <DialogTitle>...</DialogTitle>
       </DialogHeader>
       ...
     </DialogContent>
   </Dialog>
   ```

### Command Component Implementation
1. Used for advanced selection interfaces
2. Requires proper structure:
   ```tsx
   <Command>
     <CommandInput />
     <CommandEmpty />
     <CommandGroup>
       <CommandItem />
     </CommandGroup>
   </Command>
   ```

## Migration Patterns

### Component Migration Steps
1. Create new Shadcn UI component
2. Update imports in consuming components
3. Update component usage to match new API
4. Test functionality
5. Update any related components that might be affected

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Import Issues**
   - Problem: Default vs named imports causing TypeScript errors
   - Solution: Use named imports consistently across the codebase

2. **Form Structure**
   - Problem: Direct form element usage not working with Shadcn UI
   - Solution: Wrap form elements in appropriate Form* components

3. **Component Dependencies**
   - Problem: Missing peer dependencies
   - Solution: Install required packages (e.g., cmdk for Command component)

## Next Steps
1. Continue migrating remaining Material UI components
2. Focus on form components next as they have the most dependencies
3. Update documentation as new patterns emerge
4. Consider creating migration scripts to automate common transformations

## Testing Considerations
1. Verify component behavior matches original functionality
2. Test edge cases (e.g., form validation, error states)
3. Ensure accessibility features are maintained
4. Test responsive behavior

### Dashboard Components

- Key changes:
  - Migrated files:
    - app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx
    - components/dashboard/widgets/ActivePoVs.tsx

## Troubleshooting Guide
1. If TypeScript errors occur with imports:
   - Check if component is using named vs default exports
   - Verify import path is correct
   - Ensure all required sub-components are imported

2. If form components aren't working:
   - Verify Form provider is properly set up
   - Check form field naming matches schema
   - Ensure proper nesting of Form components

3. If styling issues occur:
   - Check Tailwind classes are properly applied
   - Verify theme variables are properly set
   - Check for class name conflicts
