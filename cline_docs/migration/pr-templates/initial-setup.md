# MUI to Shadcn Migration: Initial Setup

## Changes
1. Added Shadcn infrastructure:
   - Installed tailwindcss-animate and @tailwindcss/typography plugins
   - Configured tailwind.config.ts with complete theme system
   - Added CSS variables to globals.css for theming

2. Created MigrationTemplate component:
   - Implemented variant-based component switching
   - Added proper TypeScript types and ref forwarding
   - Used Tailwind CSS for Shadcn styling
   - Maintained MUI compatibility layer

3. Cleaned up dependencies:
   - Removed MUI-specific code from utils.ts
   - Kept essential utilities including cn for className merging

## Testing
- [ ] Verify Tailwind configuration works
- [ ] Test MigrationTemplate with both variants
- [ ] Ensure proper theme application
- [ ] Check dark mode support

## Documentation
- Updated Component Architecture with Shadcn patterns
- Added migration documentation
- Created component templates

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Core Components
   - Start with Button component
   - Follow with Input and Select
   - Implement form components
   - Add proper testing

2. Update testing utilities
   - Add Shadcn-specific test helpers
   - Create component test templates
   - Update test documentation

## Migration Impact
Low - This PR only adds new infrastructure without modifying existing components.

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
1. Revert to previous utils.ts
2. Remove Tailwind plugins
3. Restore original configuration

## Additional Notes
- All new components should follow the MigrationTemplate pattern
- Use variant prop to maintain backward compatibility
- Default to "shadcn" variant for new usage
