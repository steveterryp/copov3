# Launch Validation System Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Launch Validation System, including its current implementation, planned enhancements, and integration with other systems.

## Documentation Overview

### [Overview](./overview.md)

A high-level explanation of the Launch Validation System, including its purpose, core concepts, components, and workflow. This document provides a general understanding of what the system does and how it works.

### [Current Implementation](./current-implementation.md)

Detailed documentation of the current implementation of the Launch Validation System, including database schema, API routes, services, UI components, and integration points. This document also identifies limitations and gaps in the current implementation.

### [Enhanced Implementation Plan](./enhanced-implementation-plan.md)

A comprehensive plan for enhancing the Launch Validation System, addressing the limitations of the current implementation and adding new features to improve functionality, usability, and integration with other systems. The plan is divided into four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Enhanced Validation System** (2-3 weeks)
2. **Phase 2: Audit Trail and Status Management** (1-2 weeks)
3. **Phase 3: Interactive Checklist and System Integration** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features** (3-4 weeks)

### [Integration](./integration.md)

Detailed documentation of how the Launch Validation System integrates with other key systems, particularly POV Creation and CRM Integration. This document covers both the current state of integration and the planned enhancements.

### [Phase Template Integration](./phase-template-integration.md)

Comprehensive documentation of how the Launch Validation System integrates with Phase Templates, allowing users to assign phase templates during the POV launch process. This document details the implementation of template selection, validation, and application during the launch workflow.

### [KPI Integration](./kpi-integration.md)

Detailed implementation plan for integrating the KPI system with the Launch Validation system, phase templates, and CRM. This document outlines how KPIs can be configured and validated as part of the launch process, ensuring proper alignment with business objectives.

## Key Features

The Launch Validation System provides the following key features:

- **Checklist-Driven Validation**: A structured approach to validating POVs before launch
- **Status Management**: Tracking the status of the launch process
- **Validation Rules**: Criteria for determining if a POV is ready for launch
- **Launch Confirmation**: Final approval process for launching a POV
- **Audit Trail**: Tracking changes to the launch process
- **KPI Integration**: Configuration and validation of Key Performance Indicators during launch
- **Phase Template Integration**: Assignment of phase templates during the launch process
- **CRM Integration**: Synchronization with CRM systems for data consistency

## Implementation Status

The current implementation includes:

- Basic database schema for storing launch data
- Simple API routes for managing the launch process
- Basic UI components for viewing launch status and checklist
- Limited integration with other systems

The enhanced implementation will add:

- Comprehensive validation rules
- Audit trail for tracking changes
- Interactive checklist management
- Enhanced integration with POV Creation and CRM
- KPI configuration and validation during launch
- Phase template selection and application
- Advanced features like custom templates and analytics

## Getting Started
