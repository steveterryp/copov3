## Notes
- Each segment contains 5 files for manageable updates
- After each segment, we'll:
  1. Update the files
  2. Test the build
  3. Review code quality
  4. Commit changes
  5. Update this progress document
- Some files may require coordinated updates due to dependencies

## Special Cases
- Prisma-generated types (e.g., POVStatus) maintain their original casing
- When using Prisma types:
  - Import with original casing: `import { POVStatus } from '@prisma/client'`
  - Use original casing in type references: `status: POVStatus`
  - Our custom types still use PoV casing: `interface PoVDetails`
