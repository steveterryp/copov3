# POV Templates Implementation

This directory contains the implementation details for the database-driven POV templates system with JSON Schema and CRM integration. The implementation is divided into multiple phases, each building on the previous one to create a comprehensive solution.

## Overview

The POV Templates system allows for dynamic creation of POVs using customizable templates. It provides a flexible way to define the structure and validation rules for POVs, making it easier to create consistent and valid POVs across the organization. The system also integrates with CRM to enable bidirectional data flow between the POV system and external CRM systems.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into the following phases:

1. [JSON Schema Foundation](./phase1-schema-foundation.md)
   - Core JSON Schema infrastructure
   - Schema validation
   - Database model extensions
   - Basic template services

2. [Template-Based POV Creation](./phase2-template-based-creation.md)
   - Dynamic form generation
   - Template selection UI
   - POV creation flow
   - Template management UI

3. [CRM Field Mapping Integration](./phase3-crm-integration.md)
   - Enhanced field mapping
   - Template-specific sync rules
   - CRM sync service updates
   - CRM mapping configuration UI

4. [Advanced CRM Integration](./phase4-advanced-crm.md)
   - CRM-driven template selection
   - CRM data import
   - Bidirectional sync enhancements
   - Analytics and reporting

5. [Enterprise Features and Optimization](./phase5-enterprise-features.md)
   - Template inheritance and composition
   - Advanced validation rules
   - Performance optimization
   - Enterprise controls

## Key Features

- **JSON Schema-based Templates**: Define POV templates using JSON Schema for validation and structure
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Automatically generate forms based on template definitions
- **Template Inheritance**: Create new templates by inheriting from existing ones
- **CRM Integration**: Bidirectional sync with CRM systems
- **Advanced Validation**: Cross-field validation and business rule enforcement
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and optimized validation for better performance
- **Enterprise Controls**: Role-based access control and approval workflows
- **JSON Import/Export**: Update POVs (including phase changes and stage completion status) by importing JSON files

## Getting Started

To use the POV Templates system, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Template**: Use the template management UI to create a new template or inherit from an existing one
2. **Define Fields and Sections**: Add fields and organize them into sections
3. **Configure Validation Rules**: Set up validation rules for fields and cross-field validation
4. **Set Up CRM Mapping**: Configure CRM field mappings if needed
5. **Create POVs**: Use the template to create new POVs with consistent structure and validation

## Architecture

The POV Templates system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Schema Definition**: JSON Schema-based template definitions
- **Validation Service**: Validates POV data against template schemas
- **Template Service**: Manages templates and their lifecycle
- **Form Generation**: Generates dynamic forms based on templates
- **CRM Integration**: Handles bidirectional sync with CRM systems
- **UI Components**: User interface for template management and POV creation

## Best Practices

- **Use Template Inheritance**: Create base templates and inherit from them to ensure consistency
- **Define Clear Validation Rules**: Set up comprehensive validation rules to ensure data quality
- **Organize Fields into Sections**: Group related fields into sections for better usability
- **Configure CRM Mappings Carefully**: Ensure CRM field mappings are accurate to avoid data issues
- **Use Business Rules**: Define business rules to enforce organizational policies
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on performance metrics and optimize as needed

## Future Enhancements

- **Template Marketplace**: Allow sharing and discovery of templates across the organization
- **AI-Assisted Template Creation**: Use AI to suggest fields and validation rules
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights into template usage and effectiveness
- **Multi-CRM Support**: Integrate with multiple CRM systems
- **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile devices
- **Offline Mode**: Allow creating POVs offline and syncing later
