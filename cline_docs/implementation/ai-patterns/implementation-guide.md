This is a POV Management app for sales engineering staff, and POV (or PoV) means "Proof of Value". Unfortunetly I left out the ability for a pov to have a a designation for the sales theatre (ie. North America, LAC, EMEA and APJ), plus I need a customisable designation for Country and Region. Can you define a plan to apply this to the database and the project docs you have read so far.
