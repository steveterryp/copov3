Okay, this is a fantastic example dashboard to draw inspiration from! It provides a clear view of what a well-structured analytics/dashboard-driven project management tool can look like. Let's break down the features and adapt them to a Proof of Value (PoV) management context.

**Analyzing the Sales Dashboard Features**

First, let's identify the key elements of the sales dashboard you sent:

- **Overall Structure:**
    
    - **Tabbed Navigation:** Allows for different dashboards/views (e.g., "Global SE Dashboard," "Global SE Pilot Dashboard").
        
    - **Header:** Includes search, action buttons, user settings, notifications, global controls.
        
    - **Card-based Layout:** Uses individual widgets/cards for different metrics.
        
    - **Filtering:** Allows for data segmentation based on criteria (e.g. "equals APAC" for the theatre).
        
- **Metrics and Charts:**
    
    - **Revenue Metrics:** Displays sales revenue by various categories (e.g., by SE, by probability, without SE)
