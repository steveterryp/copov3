### Areas for Improvement

1. **Development Process**
    
    - Need automated testing setup earlier
    - Could improve initial component planning
    - Better initial state management design
    - More detailed API interface planning
2. **Documentation Process**
    
    - Could start documentation earlier
    - Need more code examples in guides
    - Could improve troubleshooting sections
    - Need more visual documentation

### What Worked Well

1. **Project Structure**
    
    - Feature-based organization improved code maintainability
    - Clear separation of concerns in components
    - Consistent file naming and organization
    - Easy navigation through project structure
2. **Development Approach**
    
    - TypeScript integration from start prevented type errors
    - Component-based development improved reusability
    - Material-UI theming provided consistent styling
    - Redux implementation maintained clean state management

**Getting Started with the Frontend**

1. **Wireframing:** Use a tool like Figma, Sketch, or even pen and paper to draw out basic layouts for each page. Focus on functionality and content placement.
    
2. **Component Breakdown:** Break down each view into reusable components. For example, a TaskCard, ProjectTable, Modal, etc. This helps with organization and development.
    
3. **API Integration:** As you build components, start making API calls to your backend. Work on fetching data and displaying it correctly. Consider a library like axios or the built-in fetch API for data fetching.
    
4. **State Management:** Choose a state management solution for React such as React Context or Redux, especially if you have a complex app.
    
5. **Routing:** Implement client-side routing with React Router or Next.js's built-in routing.
    

**Tips and Best Practices**

- **Start Small:** Focus on core functionality first (like creating projects and tasks), then build on top of that.
    
- **Iterate:** Get feedback from users, and be prepared to revise your designs.
    
- **Accessibility:** Keep accessibility in mind. Follow guidelines on keyboard navigation, screen reader support, etc.
    
- **Testing:** Write tests for your components and API interactions.
    
- **Design System:** Create a set of reusable components with consistent styling to ensure a cohesive look and feel.
    

**Next Steps For You**

1. **Review Your Feature List:** Make sure you understand the data needs for each feature.
    
2. **Answer the Questions:** Use the questions I provided as a guide to nail down your requirements.
    
3. **Start Wireframing:** Start with the most critical user flows and pages.
    
4. **Start with Core Components:** Build the basics like reusable input fields, buttons, table and layouts.

**Key Considerations**

- **Customization:** Provide options for users to customize dashboards, reports, and workflows.
    
- **User Experience:** Design with a focus on ease of use and intuitive navigation.
    
- **Scalability:** Build the app to handle a growing number of users and projects.
    
- **Integration:** Consider integration with other tools or platforms your users may already use.
    

**Next Steps**

1. **Prioritize Features:** Decide which features are most critical for your MVP (minimum viable product).
    
2. **Wireframe/Mockups:** Design how these features will look and flow within your application.
    
3. **Develop Iteratively:** Build features in small increments and test often.

1. **Refine User Flows:** Design detailed user flows for managing PoV licenses, tracking engagement, and handling alerts.
    
2. **Prioritize Features:** Further refine the feature list based on importance and feasibility.
    
3. **Visual Design:** Create more visual mockups incorporating the new charts, gauges, and visualizations.
    
4. **Database Design:** Think about how each of the features will be stored in a database.
