### 8. Performance

Note: While functional aspects are automated, some performance metrics require manual testing:

- Load time measurement
- Scrolling smoothness
- Visual lag assessment

## Manual Testing Supplements

While automated tests cover functionality, manual testing is still valuable for:

### Visual Verification

- Grid responsiveness to window resizing
- Animation smoothness
- Color scheme consistency
- Layout alignment

### User Experience

- Tooltip readability
- Button placement intuition
- Loading state visual feedback
- Error message clarity

### Performance Metrics

- Initial load time
- Search response time
- Scrolling performance
- Button interaction responsiveness

## Running Manual Tests

For aspects requiring manual verification:

1. Start the development server:

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm start
```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
    
3. Verify visual and performance aspects not covered by automated tests:
    
    - Window resizing behavior
    - Animation smoothness
    - Overall responsiveness
    - Visual consistency

## Notes

- Document any visual inconsistencies not caught by automated tests
- Note browser and screen size combinations tested
- Record performance metrics not captured in automated tests
- Document any user experience concerns

## Test File Location

The automated tests are located at:

```
src/frontend/src/tests/POCListView.test.jsx
```

These tests use Jest and React Testing Library, providing comprehensive coverage of component functionality while maintaining readable, maintainable test code.

## Manual Test Execution Results (Latest Run)

Date: Current  
Browser: Chrome (Puppeteer)  
Resolution: 900x600

### Visual Verification Results

✓ Grid Display

- All columns properly aligned and visible (Title, Status, Customer, Technologies, Start Date)
- Status chips showing correct colors:
    - In Progress: Blue
    - Pending Customer: Orange
    - Successful: Green
- Technology tags properly formatted and visible (React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, GraphQL, MongoDB)
- Layout maintains alignment and consistency

### Functionality Verification

✓ Search Functionality

- Search input properly responds to user interaction
- Filter works correctly (tested with "API" search term)
- Clear search button (X) functions as expected
- Results update immediately during search

✓ Refresh Functionality

- Refresh button visible and properly positioned
- Click response is immediate
- Visual feedback provided during refresh

### Performance Observations

✓ Response Times

- Initial load time: Quick and responsive
- Search filtering: Immediate response
- Button interactions: No noticeable lag

### User Experience Notes

✓ Interaction Feedback

- Search field provides clear focus indication
- Buttons have good hover states
- Status chips are easily distinguishable
- Technology tags are clearly readable

### Areas for Monitoring

- Continue monitoring performance with larger datasets
- Watch for any visual inconsistencies when window is resized beyond tested dimensions
- Monitor search performance with more complex queries

All critical manual test cases have passed, complementing the automated test coverage effectively.
