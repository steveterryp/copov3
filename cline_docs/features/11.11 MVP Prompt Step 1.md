I want to build a modern full-stack application using Next.js with the App Router. The app should serve as a project management tool for executing customer trials which are called Proof of Value (use PoV to refer to the trials). Here's what I need:_

---

#### **Frontend**

- Use **React Server Components (RSC)** for server-side rendering and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Include the following components:
    - Dashboards for tracking multiple customer PoV's and PoV related sales data (eg: Opportunity Value, sales pipeline).
    - Kanban boards for task management.
    - Calendar views for scheduling PoV phases.
    - Reporting views for PoV Success Criteria and outcomes.
- Provide role-based interfaces for managers, engineers, and customers.

---

#### **Backend**

- Use Next.js **API routes** for backend logic to handle:
    - Creating and managing PoV's, tasks, and phases.
    - Tracking PoV milestones and Success Criteria.
    - Syncing Salesforce customer and trial data periodically via cron jobs.
- Store data in **PostgreSQL**, managed by **Prisma**.
- Implement periodic Salesforce data updates (e.g., customer info and trial statuses).

---

#### **Middleware**

- Add middleware for:
    - Role-based access control (e.g., customer vs. internal user).
    - Notifications (e.g., Slack and email) for milestone completions.

---

#### **State Management**

- Use **React Query** for fetching and caching PoV data (e.g., tasks, milestones).
- Use **Zustand** for global state management of active PoV's and task dependencies.

---

#### **Tools**

- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting.
- Set up **Jest** for unit testing and **Cypress** for integration testing.
- Use **node-cron** for scheduling Salesforce data updates.
- **Chart.js** for creating visual reports of trial outcomes.

---

#### **Performance Optimization**

- Use Next.js's dynamic imports and built-in image optimization.
- Add pagination or lazy loading for customer PoV data.

---

#### **Deployment**

- Deploy the app on **Vercel** with CI/CD pipelines configured using **GitHub Actions**.

---

#### **Monitoring and Analytics**

- **Sentry** for error tracking (e.g., failed Salesforce updates).
- **Google Analytics** for tracking user behavior.

---

#### **Focus**

- Build a scalable and maintainable tool for managing Proof of Value trials (PoV's) with seamless Salesforce integration.
- Ensure the app delivers an excellent user experience with features tailored to trial management, task tracking, and reporting.
