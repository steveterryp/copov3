### **Prompt: Integrations Section**

I want to create an **Integrations** section for my app to connect with Salesforce, Email, and Slack. Each integration should include the following details:

---

#### **Salesforce Integration**

- **Functionality**:
    
    - Sync customer and trial data between the app and Salesforce.
    - Import key data (e.g., Accounts, Opportunities, and trial statuses) periodically and on-demand.
    - Push updates from the app (e.g., PoV milestones, task completions) back to Salesforce.
- **Required Information**:
    
    - Salesforce API credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, Access Token, and Refresh Token.
    - API Base URL (e.g., `https://<instance>.salesforce.com`).
- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/integrations/salesforce/sync`: Trigger a manual sync with Salesforce to pull the latest data.
- **Testing**:
    
    - Set up mock Salesforce data in a sandbox environment.
    - Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoint, passing appropriate headers and tokens.
    - Validate data consistency in both systems after sync.

#### **Email Integration**

- **Functionality**:
    
    - Send automated notifications and updates to customers, engineers, and managers.
    - Allow customizable email templates for PoV-related communications.
- **Required Information**:
    
    - SMTP credentials: Host, Port, Username, Password.
    - Sender email address and name.
    - Optional: API credentials for email providers like SendGrid or SES.
- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/integrations/email/test`: Test email sending by triggering a sample notification email.
- **Testing**:
    
    - Provide a valid test email address in the payload.
    - Verify that the email is delivered correctly, with no errors in formatting or content.
    - Test different scenarios (e.g., success, failure, invalid credentials).

#### **Slack Integration**

- **Functionality**:
    
    - Send real-time notifications to Slack channels for important events (e.g., PoV milestone updates, task status changes).
    - Enable posting messages to specific channels or direct messages to users.
- **Required Information**:
    
    - Slack API credentials: Bot Token, Signing Secret.
    - Channel or User IDs for notifications.
    - Optional: Webhook URLs for posting messages.
- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/integrations/slack/send-test`: Trigger a test message to a specified channel or user.
- **Testing**:
    
    - Use the Slack API Test Tool to validate credentials.
    - Call the test endpoint with a sample message payload.
    - Confirm message delivery in the specified Slack workspace and channel.

### **Implementation Notes**:

1. All integrations should include detailed error handling and logging for troubleshooting.
2. Add configuration options in the appâ€™s admin interface to manage credentials and settings for each integration.
3. Ensure secure storage of sensitive information (e.g., use environment variables or encrypted database fields).

### **Testing Overall**:

- Develop integration tests using mock APIs or sandbox environments for Salesforce, Email, and Slack.
- Include test cases for invalid credentials, network errors, and payload validation.
- Document the setup process and usage of each endpoint for team members and users.
