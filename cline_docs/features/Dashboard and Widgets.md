**New Visualizations (Inspired by the Dashboards)**

- **Gauge Charts:** Use gauges for visualizing things like license expiry, record update status, account health.
    
- **Donut Charts:** Use donut charts for visualizing project status, stalled vs. non-stalled pilots, and active vs. non-active.
    
- **Stacked Bar Charts:** Use stacked bar charts for tracking progress of PoVs and by status.
    
- **Traffic Light Cards:** Use traffic light cards to quickly visualize accounts nearing end of life.
    
- **Number Cards:** Show key totals and stats using number cards for a quick overview of high-priority data.
