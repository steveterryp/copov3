## Routing Implementation

**Date:** September 11, 2023  
**Decision:** React Router with protected routes  
**Rationale:**

- Industry standard routing solution
- Good TypeScript support
- Easy to implement protected routes
- Flexible routing configuration  
    **Impact:** Positive - Clean and secure routing system

- Create routes for other controllers (POC, Tasks)
- [ ]  Implement initial endpoints for:
    - POC management
    - Task tracking
    - Integration status
    - POC list view
    - POC details view
    - Dashboard view


### POC Routes Implementation Strategy (Latest Decision)

- **Decision**: Implement simplified routes with mock data initially
- **Rationale**:
    - Enables frontend development without database dependencies
    - Provides predictable test data
    - Facilitates rapid prototyping and testing
    - Allows gradual migration to full implementation
- **Implementation Details**:
    - Populate database with mock data matches POC model schema
    - Supports core POC fields and virtual properties
    - Includes realistic test scenarios
    - Maintains API contract for future migration

### API Service Design

- Created modular APIService class in `src/js/api.js`
- Implemented methods for:
    1. User Authentication (login, register, logout)
    2. POC Management
    3. Task Management
    4. Integration Management

### POC Route Features

- Current Implementation (Mock Data):
    
    - Simplified routes with predictable test data
    - Core POC fields and virtual properties support
    - Frontend development-friendly structure
    - Easy testing and demonstration capabilities
- Planned Full Implementation:
    
    - Full CRUD operations for POCs
    - Role-based access control
    - Advanced filtering and pagination
    - Note management endpoints
    - POC statistics and summary routes
    - CSV export functionality
    - Secure, authenticated access

### Route Management Capabilities

- Current Implementation:
    
    - Basic CRUD operations with mock data
    - In-memory filtering and search
    - Status-based operations
    - Technology and customer filtering
- Future Implementation:
    
    - Database-backed CRUD operations
    - Advanced querying options
    - Comprehensive access control
    - Integration with authentication middleware
    - Real-time updates via WebSocket
    - External service integrations
