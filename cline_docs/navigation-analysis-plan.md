# Navigation Analysis Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to analyzing and improving the application's navigation structure. We'll use a three-phase approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and understanding of our navigation system.

## Current State
- Next.js app router implementation
- Multiple navigation components (AdminNav, SideNav, etc.)
- Mix of authenticated and public routes
- Dynamic route handling

## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1: Automated Route Analysis
A non-destructive analysis of our current navigation structure.

#### Components to Analyze
- App Router routes
- Navigation components
- Link patterns
- Access controls

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Non-destructive analysis script
interface RouteAnalysis {
  routes: Route[];
  navigationLinks: Link[];
  orphanedPages: Route[];
  duplicateRoutes: Route[];
}
```

#### Expected Outcomes
- Complete route map
- Navigation coverage report
- Orphaned page identification
- Duplicate functionality detection

### Phase 2: Visual Navigation Mapping
Visual documentation of navigation flows and user journeys.

#### Areas to Document
- Main navigation paths
- User role-specific flows
- State transitions
- Error states

#### Implementation
- Screenshot capture system
- Flow diagram generation
- UI pattern documentation

### Phase 3: Interactive Testing
Automated testing of navigation patterns and user flows.

#### Test Coverage
- Navigation accessibility
- Role-based access
- Performance metrics
- Error handling

## Success Metrics
1. 100% route documentation
2. No orphaned pages
3. Clear navigation patterns
4. Documented user flows
5. Performance baselines

## Tools and Dependencies
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Playwright/Puppeteer
- React DevTools
- TanStack Router

## Implementation Notes
- All analysis will be non-destructive
- Focus on documentation first
- Improvements planned separately
- Regular progress commits
