   - /admin/dashboard
   - /admin/crm/* (3 nested routes)
   - /admin/permissions
   - /admin/roles
   - /admin/phases
   - /admin/users
   Analysis: Good route grouping, consistent use of layouts for major sections

3. POV Management Routes (15 routes)
   - /pov/create
   - /pov/list
   - /pov/:povId (with layout.tsx)
   - 12 nested dynamic routes under :povId
   Analysis: Well-structured dynamic routes, proper parameter handling

4. Support & Utility Routes (6 routes)
   - /dashboard
   - /profile
   - /support/feature
   - /support/request
   - /test-auth
   - / (home)
   Analysis: Mix of top-level and grouped routes

#### Navigation Component Analysis

1. AdminNav.tsx (components/layout/AdminNav.tsx)
   - Uses dynamic link generation
   - Handles admin section navigation
   - Found in admin layout
   - Potential issue: Dynamic links lack type safety

2. MobileNav.tsx (components/layout/MobileNav.tsx)
   - Uses dynamic link generation
   - Handles responsive navigation
   - Used across multiple layouts
   - Potential issue: Dynamic links lack type safety

3. Navigation Patterns Found
   - Consistent use of Next.js Link component
   - Dynamic route parameter handling
   - Layout-specific navigation components
   - Mobile-first responsive design

#### Route Analysis Findings

1. Route Organization
   - Clear grouping by functionality
   - Consistent use of dynamic parameters
   - Proper use of Next.js app router conventions
   - Layout files placed appropriately

2. Navigation Coverage
   - Authentication pages intentionally orphaned (expected)
   - Admin pages use programmatic navigation
   - POV pages follow dynamic routing patterns
   - Support pages accessible through user menu

3. Route Patterns Identified
   - Authentication: /auth/* (public access)
   - Admin: /admin/* (protected access)
   - POV: /pov/:povId/* (dynamic routes)
   - Support: /support/* (user services)

4. Technical Implementation
   - App router structure followed
   - Layout files used effectively
   - Dynamic parameters handled properly
   - Route groups implemented correctly
